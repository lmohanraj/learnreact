      <p>
        React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source
        front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI
        components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community
        of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in
        the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is
        only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the
        DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of
        additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side
        functionality.
